For the test project a small web app/mobile app should be created which utilizes a simple JSON rest API.
The test is aimed to last about 1-2 hours and should NOT exceed 2 hours as it is NOT expected that
the complete scope will be finished as each developer has his own speed, coding style, approach and
background knowledge. So itâ€™s up to the developer to manage his own priorities for this test project.
The app itself can be developed either as a Vue web app, Angular web app, Ionic mobile app, native
Android mobile app or native iOS mobile app depending

What we're building:

- show three tabs with predifined cities(Rio De Janeiro, Beijing and Los Angeles)
- Connect to backend to get weather data
- Show for the selected city a forcase for the next hours and the next days should be presented
- User should get ability to refresh data
- On the next page is a mockup for the small weather app

Bonus: search for city
